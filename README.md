# Jarvis Virtual Personal Assistant
 We developed this project in python using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. This project helps user to automate some day to day desktop tasks of user. We control desktop through our voice. JARVIS can open apps, set remainders, tells news and controls system functions. We built GUI interface also, using Tkinter module.
